## Description

An important part of any computer graphics course, in my opinion, is having the opportunity to build a project that you care about. The final project in this course showcases your creativity from what you have learned over the semester and can be used as a portfolio piece for future internship, co-op, and full-time job opportunities.  We have covered enough computer graphics now that you are ready to design and create a project from scratch.
  
## Expectations

You can work on any idea you want that is within the scope of graphics. You may explore areas that we did not cover heavily in class (Animation, particles, different rendering techniques, advanced shaders, image processing, volume rendering, etc.).  Your final project should be on the order of the difficulty beyond the homeworks.  

## Project Ideas

I am going to list a few project ideas that I think are within the scope of this class.

* Procedural generation
  * Terrain rendering [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjTPIbJNO6I]

  * Racing game [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzFWnadOdY]
* Shaders
  * Create a world with many different shaders
    * Cel / Toon shaders [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWTQuvXm2HU]
    * Bump / Normal / Parallax / Relief mapping [Example]
  * Deferred rendering [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIrq4sF5QO8]

### Assignment strategy

My suggested strategy for this project is to:

* You will have plenty of time to think about the project you want to deliver, but get started early.
* You can get feedback from me ahead of time on nearly any graphics related topic, do so!
* Find your teammates early if you choose to work in a team!
  * Piazza is a good resource, and the week I am gone from GDC will be the time to get started!
  
### How to run your program

Use the `build.py`. You can modify build.py to your needs, but I should be able to type `python build.py` and then run the generated executable. I plan to spend 0 time figuring out what dependencies to download. If there is some setup needed

Pretend you are deploying this software to someone who has no idea what your code does and needs to be able to run it. You can assume your user has SDL2 setup however.

### Video deliverable

For this project, you need to make a video recording of your project. Here are the specifications:

- Give an ~2-3 minute overview of your implementation as a youtube video.
- Explain what your project is (i.e. You should be talking in your video as you show things)
- Show what was achieved (e.g. moving a camera around and talking over) 
- In the video highlight one particular technical achievement
  - e.g. Part of the code or algorithm that does something neat or was difficult to get right.
    - Give a quick 'tutorial' like summary of how you solved the problem.
    
Videos will publicly be uploaded to the course websites 'hall of fame'.

Here is a sample from previous years:

- https://youtu.be/cGB8C6IT8eE
  - I like this sample because:
    - I can hear the speakers voice.
    - The talk is well outlined and concise.
    - The speaker shows off the technical parts of the code well.
    - The speaker shows the actual visuals.
    - It is not a very long video.

### Deliverables

* You need to commit your code to this repository.
* Your program needs to compile using a build.py script
* Put a link to a youtube/vimeo video in this README.md.

### Rubric

* (33.3%) Project Complection
  * Does the project compile and run
  * Is it polished without any bugs (No weird visual artifacts)
  * Did you make a video?
* (33.3%) Technical
  * Was the implementation of the project challenging?
    * Even if you followed a tutoral, it should not be trivial, and have some personal touche to it.
  * Did you have to organize/process a sufficient amount of data?
  * Was it clear you consulted some outside resources that go above and beyond the scope of this class?
* (33.4%) Creativity
  * How visually appealing is the scene?
    * Note: There should be some 'wow' factor--instructors discretion is used here.
  * How original is the project
    * Again, did you enhance a tutorial and do something unique or just go by the book?
